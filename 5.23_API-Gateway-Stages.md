### API Gateway Stage

- Logical Reference: References the lifecycle state of the API (e.g., dev, prod, v3, etc).
- Identified: Each state can be associated with a different endpoint (e.g., dev, prod, or test environment).
- Invoke URL: Each stage has a unique invoke URL.

### Stage Variables

These can be used in the API Gateway to create variables that reference specific backend endpoints. Different stages can send incoming requests to different functions (e.g. for development or testing).
