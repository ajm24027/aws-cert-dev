### S3 Encryption

- Supports Encryption in Transit, like:

1. SSL/TLS
2. HTTPS

- Supports Encryption at Rest: Server-Side Encryption

SSE-S3 - S3-Managed Keys, use AES 256-bit encryption >> Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256). Protecting data using server-side encryption.

SSE-KMS - AWS Key Management Service-Managed Keys
SSE-C - customer provided/managed keys

SSE-S3 is enabled by default.

Additionally, we can encrypt data on the client-side before it's uploaded to S3.

### Enforcing Encryption via Bucket Policy

1. Explicitly deny requests that do not include the x-amz-server-side-encryption parameter in the request header.
2. Deny requests that do not use aws:SecureTransport to enforce the use of HTTPS/SSL.
