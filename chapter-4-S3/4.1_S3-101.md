### What is S3?

Simple (object) Storage Solution

Very scalable, allowing a user to store any amount of data for a very low cost.

- Manage Data as objects rather than systems or data blocks.

- Cannot be used to run an OS or Database.

- Objects in a bucket can be up to 5TB in size.

- Example S3 Bucket: https://bucket-name./s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name: objects, keys, key-value pairs. https://ajmedina/s3.Region.amazonaws.com/milo.png

- key = milo.png

- value is the data itself that belongs to the key of milo.png. Objects store key-value pairs.

- Highly available, highly durable (safe place to store data).

#### Characteristics

Tiered Storage

Lifecycle Managament - define rules to automatically transition objects to cheaper storage tiers

Versioning - All versions of an object can be stored and retrieved. Allowing you to roll back to a previous version of a file.

#### Securing Data

Server-Side Encryption - you can set default encryption on a bucket to encrypt new objects when they are stored in a bucket.

Access Control list - Define which AWS accounts/groups are granted access to a bucket. Attached to individual objects within a bucket.

Bucket Policy - specify what actions are allowed or denied in a bucket.

#### Exam Tips

Store any file that is not a DB or OS.

Store Files up to 5TB at once.

Unlimited Storage.

S3 Universal names space, every bucket name must be unique.

Key = object name

Value = the data in the object
