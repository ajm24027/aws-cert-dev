### What is the purpose of Origin Access Control?

Sometimes we want to restrict access to the Origin of our resources. That is, we want to restrict access to the S3 Bucket that is the origin of files and images, etc.

To do this with CloudFront we have to create a new Origin Access Identity when creating a new CloudFront Distribution. Once we do this we have to go back to the S3 bucket, and enable "Use OAI", and turn on "Block Public Access".

Once we do this, we should be able to still access our content via the CloudFront distribution, but not the S3 Bucket.
