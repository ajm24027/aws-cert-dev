# Introduction to DynamoDB

## What is DynamoDB?

- Fast and flexible NoSQL database
- Stores and retrieves data without defining a rigid schema upfront
- Alternative to relational databases like Oracle and SQL Server
- Great for applications needing consistent single-digit millisecond latency at any scale
- Fully managed database supporting key-value and document data models (JSON, HTML, XML)
- Ideal for mobile, web, gaming, ad tech, IoT, and many other applications
- Serverless and integrates well with Lambda
- Autoscalable, popular choice for serverless applications

## Data Storage and Consistency

- Data stored on SSDs for fast reads and writes
- Underlying hardware spread across 3 data centers for fault tolerance
- Two consistency models for read operations:
  - **Eventually consistent (default):** Consistency across copies usually reached within 1 second, best for performance.
  - **Strongly consistent:** All successful writes reflected across all locations, best for read consistency.
- Supports ACID transactions (atomic, consistent, isolated, durable) for all-or-nothing operations like credit card payments.

## Data Structure

- Data organized in tables and items (data records)
- Examples: player data with inventory and coins, object availability and ownership
- Items composed of attributes (columns)
- Key-value data structure: key is the data name (e.g., player ID), value is the data itself

## Primary Keys

- Allow querying data in the table
- Two types: partition key and composite key
- **Partition key:** Unique attribute (e.g., customer ID, product ID) used for internal hash function determining data storage location. No two items can have the same partition key.
- **Composite key:** Combination of partition key and sort key (e.g., user ID + timestamp) used when partition key isn't unique (e.g., forum posts). Ensures unique primary key even with duplicate partition keys.
- Items with same partition key stored together and sorted by sort key value.

## Exam Tips

- DynamoDB: low latency, NoSQL, documents/key-value (JSON, HTML, XML)
- Consistency models: eventually consistent (fast reads, 1s delay for updates), strongly consistent (consistent reads)
- ACID transactions: all-or-nothing operations like credit card payments
- Structure: tables, items (rows), attributes (columns)
- Primary keys: partition (unique ID), composite (partition + sort key)
