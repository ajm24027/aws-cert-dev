### How does CloudFront work?

Many Networks around the world are linked together to serve content at a particular region. How many hops content takes to reach a geographic region determines how well a piece of content might get served to an end user.

Edge Location - Collection of servers, a data center that caches content, and allows other networks to access. When content is cached once at an edge location, that content can be served from a cached version, reducing the number of hops content takes to reach an AWS Region.

CloudFront Origin - the location of the files that you wish to distribute to other edge locations.

CloudFront Distribution - name given to origin and configuration settings of the content that needs to be distributed via the CDN.

### Why Cloudfront?

Deliver an entire website, via the nearest edge location so content is delivered with the best performance. 

Works with, Non-AWS-Origin Server, S3, EC2, Route 53.

Objects are cached for a TTL, which is by default, 1 day. You can clear this cache, but you are charged for doing so.
