### How RDS Proxy Works

Application <> RDS Proxy <> RDS Database

- Serverless and scales automatically, to workloads through pooling and sharing database connections.
- Also preserves application connections during failover.
- And deployable to multi-AZ for protection against infrastructure failure.

* Note to self: This just feels like a really good resource for important and big database networks. I'm thinking about financial transactions, etc.
