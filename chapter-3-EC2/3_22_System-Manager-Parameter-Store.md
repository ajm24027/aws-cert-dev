### What is Parameter Store?

Parameters like API Key's, database connection information, usernames, passwords, etc.

A lot like when we stored .env variables in Heroku for GameNight before we launched.

Parameter Store is a place to securely store parameters for our various resources and entities.

Integrates with EC2, CloudFormation, Lambda, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy.

_Not to be confused with secrets manager_
