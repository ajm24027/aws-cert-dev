### AMIs are Regional

AMIs exist in a single region, if you want to access an AMI in a different region, you'll need to create a copy of the AMI, and select the region where you want it to be copied to.

### Encryption & Copying

Unencrypted AMI > Unencrypted AMI - has option to encrypt.
Encrypted AMI > Encrypted AMI - has option to encrypt.
Unencrypted AMI > Encrypted AMI - has option to encrypt.
Encrypted AMI > Unencrypted AMI - no option to encrypt.

If no encryption options selected, the encryption on the copy will match the encryption settings on the original AMI.
