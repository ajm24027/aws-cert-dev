### API Gateway Mock Endpoints

`Mock Integration`

Allow devs to do the following without ever needing to have a functioning backend or a Real API to be available:

1. Create Software
2. Test Software
3. Debug Software

#### Use Case

> Dev Team has finished creating frontend components and are ready to test.
> The backend components are not ready.
> Use an API Gateway mock integration endpoint to simulate the backend response.
