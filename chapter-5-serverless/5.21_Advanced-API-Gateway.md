### Advanced Features of API Gateway

#### Importing and updating existing APIs

1. Importing API Definition Files - We can use the API Gateway Import to import an API using a definition file.

2. OpenAPI, formerly known as Swagger, is supported.

3. We can create and update existing APIs - We can use an OpenAPI definition file to create a new API or update an existing API.

#### Legacy Protocols

SOAP which returns an XML format instead of JSON is a legacy protocol.

We can configure API Gateway as a SOAP web service passthrough.

We can also transform XML responses into JSON response data.
