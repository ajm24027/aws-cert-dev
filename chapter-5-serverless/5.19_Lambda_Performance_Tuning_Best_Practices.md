### Memory and CPU Capacity

CPU Capacity is controlled by configuring function memory. From 128MB up to 10,240MB. Functions that import libraries and interact with data loaded from other services need more than 128MB.

Adding memory will improve performance if the function is either memory or CPU bound.

Adding memory may reduce the time it takes to execute the function.

### Execution Envrionment

The first time that the Lambda Function fires, an execution environment is created > the code is downloaded to the execution environment > then configuration is set up (memory, runtime, etc.) > Then runs the function static initialization code, importing libraries and dependencies > Finally the code is executed.

The static initialization phase is often the largest contributor to latency.

### How to Optimize Static Initialization Phase

To optimize this phase and reduce the latency of the function consider the following.

1. Code: amount of code that needs to run during this phase.
2. Function Package Size: Including libraries, dependencies, and lambda layers that need to be imported.
3. Performance: Libraries and other services that require connections that need to be set up (S3 or DynamoDB).

When possible we should avoid importing an entire SDK, if we only need DynamoDB, import only DynamoDB from the AWS SDK.
