### Lambda Deployment Package

When creating a Lamdba Function in the console, a zip file is automatically created by Lambda (the deployment file).

The Deployment package is the Applications Code, and any dependencies that are needed to run the file.

### What to do with Deployment Packages greater than 50MB

With deployment packages greater than 50MB, you'll need to upload the package to S3, and target that file in the Lambda Function.

### Lambda Layers

A work around is Lambda Layers, a zip file archive that can be refrerenced by the Lambda Function, and can have dependencies, libraries, and custom runtimes, etc.

Once the Layer is created, it can be used by multiple functions. These layers are small in size, making the initialization of the function faster.
