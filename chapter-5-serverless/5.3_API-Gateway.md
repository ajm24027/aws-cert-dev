### Understanding API Gateway?

API = Application Programming Interface > Restaurant, waitier, chef analogy.

A travel site might use user input to configure any number of API calls to many different services, retrieve the information, and return all of it to the user, so they can make an educated choice of where they'd like to spend their holiday.

API Gateway is the Front Door to our EC2 Instances and Lambda Functions.

#### Supported API Types:

- Restful API - optimized for stateless and serverless workloads.
- Websockets API - for real-time, two way, stateful communication like chat apps.

Dev Cert focuses on Restful because of the focus on serverless and stateless workloads.

API Gateway serves as a single endpoint for all client traffic interacting with the back end of a website. It allows us to connect users to our Lambda, EC2, or Elastic Beanstalk services like DynamoDB and Kinesis.

- Supports multiple endpoints.

#### Exam TIps

API Gateway is the front door to an application, and it providesw a single endpoint for use with an application

Serverless (cost effective & scalable).

Supports Throttling, to prevent application from being overloaded by too many request.
