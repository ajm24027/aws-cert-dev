### Example Use Case

What if you have a Private VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) thta contains a Private Subnet (consisting of a RDS database and or EC2 Instance). Perhaps we have a Lambda Function that needs to read or write to the database or shutsdown the EC2 instance in response to a security alert. By default the Lambda function will not have access to the private subnet. This functionality needs to be allowed so that the Lambda Function can connect.

3 things that the Lambda Function needs to access the above subnet:

1. Specify the VPC the Lambda Function needs to access.
2. Select the subnets that the Lambda Function will use.
3. Attach the function to a security group that has access to the subnet.

Create Lambda Function > Select Configuration > Select Execution Role > Add permissions > Attach policies > search for "AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole" > Add Permissions > Go back to Lambda Configuration > Click VPC > Select Edit > select the VPC, Private Subnets, and the security group that has access to the above.

#### Exam Tips

- It's possible to enable Lambda to access resources that are inside a private VPC.
- It needs to have the VPC ID, private subnet ID, and security group ID.
- Lambda creates ENIs using IPs from the private subnets. The security group allows the function to access the resources in the VPC.
