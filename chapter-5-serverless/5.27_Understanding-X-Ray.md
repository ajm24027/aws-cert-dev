### What is X-Ray?

X-Ray is a tool which helps devs analyze and debug distributed applications. Allowing one to troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors.

Provides an an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through an application, collecting information on:

- Latency
- HTTP Status Codes
- Errors

#### Integrating X-Ray with Applications

Can be used with EC2, Elastic Container Service, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, Elastic Load Balance, and API Gateway.

And can be used on Apps written in Java, Node, .NET, Go, Ruby, and Python.

The X-Ray SDK automatically captures metadata about API calls made to AWS Services using the AWS SDK.

To get X-Ray working with an application:

1. Install X-Ray Agent - install the agent on an EC2 Instance.
2. Configure - Instrument your application using the X-Ray SDK.
3. The X-Ray SDK - X-Ray SDK gathers information from requests and response headers, the code in an application, and metadata about the AWS resources on which it runs, and sends the trace data to X-Ray. E.g. incoming HTTP requests, error codes, latency data.
