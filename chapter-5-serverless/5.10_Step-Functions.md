### What are Step Functions?

Step Functions provide a visual interface for serverless applications, which enables you to build, and run serverless applications as a series of steps.

Each step executed in an order decided by business logic.

Things to consider adding would be sequencing, error handling, and rety logic, so that the application executes in order, and as expected.

#### Example - Sequential Workflow

1. Decode base64 string.
2. Generate statistics.
3. Remove special characters.
4. Tokenize and count.

Output of one function or step is the input of another function/step.

#### Example - Parallel Workflow

1. Process Photo.
   2a. Extract metadata.
   2b. Resize Image.
   2c. Facial Recognition
2. Load in database.

#### Example - Branching Workflow

1. Trigger CodeBuild Build
2. Get Test Results.
3. All test past?
   True. Notify success.
   False. Notify failure.

### Exam Tips

Step Functions are a great way to visualize a serverless application

Step Functions automatically trigger and track each step. The output of one step is often the input of the next.

Step Functions log the state of each step, so if something goes wrong you can track what went wrong, and where.
