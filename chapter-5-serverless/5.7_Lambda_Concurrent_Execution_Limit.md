### Concurrent Executions

Lambda has a limit on a number of functions that can be executed across all functions in a given region per account.

The default is 1,000 per region, and the error that one would get if this limit were surpassed would be: 429 - "TooManyRequestsException".

You have to submit a request to AWS Support Center if you want to have your accounts limit increased.

You can set up a Reserved Concurrency, guarantees a set number of concurrent executions that are always available to a critical function.
