### Serverless Summary 3

#### Serverless Architecture Exam Tips:

1. Event Driven & Asynchronous: an event or message might trigger an action, but no response is given or required.
2. Building Blocks: Think of AWS Services as building blocks that can be put together to create an application.
3. Loosely Coupled: SQS allows one to queue messages and EventBridge helps one to handle events and route them to the right application components (or services).
4. Flexibility & Scalability: Services and components operate and scale independently of each other.

##### The Example Banking Application:

A customer goes onto the Application and makes a withdrawl > That request is sent to API Gateway and triggers a Lambda Function to process the withdrawl > The Lambda Function updates a DynamoDB table > The update triggers an event via EventBridge: - If the customer overdraws from their account EventBridge triggers an overDraft Lambda Function that begins the workflow to send the customer the option to increase their overdraft limit. - Also, EventBridge triggers SNS to send the customer a notification advising them of the overdraft from their account.

##### The Example Image Processing Application:

A user uploads image to an S3 bucket > That addition to the S3 Bucket, triggers a Lambda function that processes the image resizing it to a thumbnail view > the new processed image is sent to another bucket or folder in the bucket - at the same time, the images metadata gets stored in a DynamoDB table > finally, CloudFront serves up all of the new processed images when a client accesses it.

##### The Example Social Media Application:

The app takes in Social Media Events via Kinesis > Kinesis Firehose takes the realtime data and sends it to a Lambda Function > the results of the function get stored in a DynamoDB.

#### Ephemeral and Persistent Data Storage:

Native with Lambda:

- /tmp (ephemeral storage): Used for Temp Data. Size Limit of 512mb to 10gb. Dynamic read/write capabilities. Shared within execution environment.
- Lambda Layer: Used for SDKs and Libraries. Size Limit of 50mb zipped or 250mb unzipped. Updates require a new layer. Shared across execution environments.

External Storage Options:

- S3: Used for peristent data. Elastic size limit. Store and retrieve data. Shared across execution environments.
- EFS: Used for peristent data. Elastic size limit. Dynamic read/write. Shared across execution environments.
