### What is $LATEST

On creation, there is only one version of the lambda function: $LATEST. When uploading a new version of that Lambda Code, that newest version becomes $LATEST.

- It is possible to create multiple versions of functioning code, and use aliases to identify the variants of that code.

You might give Version 1 of code the alias name: Prod
Version 2 of the code might have the alias name: Test

You might target each using the Amazon Resource NAME (ARN):
aws:lambda:us-east-1:123425345A:function:mylambda:Prod
aws:lambda:us-east-1:123425345A:function:mylambda:Test or aws:lambda:us-east-1:123425345A:function:mylambda:$LATEST

The reason "Test" can be targeted with $LATEST is because it is the latest version. If another code/alias was added then that would then be the $LATEST. Just make a note of this in code to know which code you want to target.
